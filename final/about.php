            <h2>Our Founders</h2>
            <p>Meet Aaron Perkel and Lily Bonds, two university students who have a passion for bicycles and wanted to 
                share their love and knowledge with the Burlington area. Founded in 2024, Lily and Aaron's passion for bikes and 
                knack for fixing anything on two wheels led them to create a haven for fellow cycling enthusiasts. 
                Both students bring their expertise in bikes and business to the shop, and they're committed to providing top-notch service and fostering a community where every bike lover feels at home.
